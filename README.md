# GOTR Volunteer Coordination Platform Demo

## 🏃‍♀️ Overview

This is a comprehensive demo of a volunteer coordination platform designed specifically for Girls on the Run International (GOTR).

## 🎯 Key Pain Points Addressed

2. **Compliance Tracking** - Comprehensive tracking of 13+ certification types (vs. 2 in Pinwheel)
3. **Background Check Integration** - Full integration with Sterling Volunteers and Checkr
4. **Multi-Council Oversight** - Real-time visibility across all councils for national leadership
